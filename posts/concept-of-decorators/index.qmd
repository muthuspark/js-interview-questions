JavaScript decorators, a powerful feature increasingly prevalent in modern JavaScript development, provide a concise and expressive way to modify or enhance functions and classes.  While not a built-in language feature in the same way they are in languages like Python, decorators in JavaScript are achieved through a combination of higher-order functions and metadata.  This post will break down the concept, providing clear examples to illustrate their practical application.

## What are JavaScript Decorators?

At their core, JavaScript decorators are functions that take another function (or class) as input and return a modified version of that function (or class).  They allow you to add extra functionality – logging, validation, or other enhancements – without directly altering the original function's code. This promotes cleaner, more maintainable code, reducing the risk of introducing bugs.

Think of them as "wrappers" that add capabilities before or after the original function executes.  This aspect of wrapping and extending functionality is key to understanding how decorators work.


## Implementing Decorators in JavaScript

JavaScript doesn't natively support decorators like Python, but we can effectively simulate them using a function that returns a modified function:

```javascript
function myDecorator(originalFunction) {
  return function(...args) {
    console.log("Before function execution");
    const result = originalFunction(...args);
    console.log("After function execution");
    return result;
  };
}

function sayHello(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

const decoratedSayHello = myDecorator(sayHello);
decoratedSayHello("World");
```

In this example, `myDecorator` is our decorator. It takes `sayHello` as input and returns a new function that logs messages before and after the original `sayHello` function executes.


## Decorators with Parameterized Functionality

We can make decorators more flexible by allowing them to accept parameters:

```javascript
function loggingDecorator(prefix) {
  return function(originalFunction) {
    return function(...args) {
      console.log(`${prefix}: Before function execution`);
      const result = originalFunction(...args);
      console.log(`${prefix}: After function execution`);
      return result;
    };
  };
}

function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

const decoratedAdd = loggingDecorator("Addition")(add);
console.log(decoratedAdd(5, 3));
```

Here, `loggingDecorator` accepts a `prefix` parameter, allowing us to customize the log messages.  Notice the nested function structure; this is crucial for handling the parameter passing.

## Decorators with Class Methods

Decorators can also enhance class methods:

```javascript
function makeSecure(target, name, descriptor) {
  const originalMethod = descriptor.value;
  descriptor.value = function (...args) {
    console.log("Authenticating...");
    const result = originalMethod.apply(this, args);
    console.log("Access Granted.");
    return result;
  };
}

class User {
  @makeSecure
  getInfo(password) {
    if (password === 'secret') {
      return "Access allowed!";
    } else {
      return "Access denied!";
    }
  }
}

const user = new User();
console.log(user.getInfo('secret'));
```

This example shows a decorator (`makeSecure`) modifying a class method (`getInfo`).  The `target`, `name`, and `descriptor` parameters provide metadata about the method being decorated.  This illustrates a more advanced use, approaching the syntax found in languages with native decorator support.  Note that the `@` syntax here is merely stylistic convention and doesn't have native meaning in JavaScript without the use of a transpiler like Babel.
