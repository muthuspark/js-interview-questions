Reversing a linked list is a classic computer science problem that tests your understanding of data structures and algorithms.  This post will guide you through implementing a function to reverse a singly linked list in JavaScript, providing clear explanations and code examples.

We'll start by defining a simple Node class to represent elements within our linked list:

```javascript
class Node {
  constructor(data) {
    this.data = data;
    this.next = null;
  }
}
```

Now let's create the function to reverse the linked list.  There are many ways to approach this, but a common and efficient method involves iteratively updating pointers.  We'll use three pointers: `previous`, `current`, and `next`.

```javascript
function reverseLinkedList(head) {
  let previous = null;
  let current = head;
  let next = null;

  while (current !== null) {
    // Store the next node
    next = current.next;

    // Reverse the pointer
    current.next = previous;

    // Move pointers one step forward
    previous = current;
    current = next;
  }

  // The 'previous' pointer now points to the new head
  return previous;
}
```

Let's break down the `reverseLinkedList` function step-by-step:

1. **Initialization:** We initialize three pointers: `previous` to `null` (initially, no node points to the reversed list), `current` to the `head` of the list, and `next` to `null` (will store the next node to be processed).

2. **Iteration:** The `while` loop continues as long as `current` is not `null` (we haven't reached the end of the list).

3. **Storing the Next Node:** `next = current.next;` saves a reference to the next node in the list before we modify `current.next`. This avoids losing the rest of the list.

4. **Reversing the Pointer:** `current.next = previous;` reverses the direction of the `next` pointer of the current node.  It now points to the previous node.

5. **Moving Pointers:** `previous = current;` and `current = next;` update the `previous` and `current` pointers to move one step forward in the reversed list.

6. **Returning the New Head:** After the loop completes, `previous` will point to the new head of the reversed linked list.


Here's how you would use this function:

```javascript
// Create a sample linked list: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
let head = new Node(1);
head.next = new Node(2);
head.next.next = new Node(3);
head.next.next.next = new Node(4);
head.next.next.next.next = new Node(5);

// Reverse the linked list
let reversedHead = reverseLinkedList(head);

// Print the reversed linked list
let current = reversedHead;
while (current !== null) {
  console.log(current.data);
  current = current.next;
}
// Output: 5 4 3 2 1
```

This example demonstrates how to create a linked list, reverse it using `reverseLinkedList`, and then print the reversed list to the console.  Remember that this implementation works for singly linked lists.  Reversing doubly linked lists requires a slightly different approach.  This method provides an efficient and clear solution to the problem of reversing a singly linked list in JavaScript.
