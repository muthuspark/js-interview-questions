## What is FizzBuzz?

The FizzBuzz challenge is straightforward: write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. However, for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number. For multiples of five, print "Buzz." For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz."

## The Classic Approach (using `if`, `else if`, and `else`)

This is the most common and easily understood solution. We use nested `if` statements to check the divisibility of the number by 3 and 5.

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
  if (i % 3 === 0 && i % 5 === 0) {
    console.log("FizzBuzz");
  } else if (i % 3 === 0) {
    console.log("Fizz");
  } else if (i % 5 === 0) {
    console.log("Buzz");
  } else {
    console.log(i);
  }
}
```

This code iterates through numbers 1 to 100.  The modulo operator (`%`) gives us the remainder after division. If the remainder is 0, the number is divisible.

## A More Concise Approach (using a ternary operator)

We can make the code more compact using JavaScript's ternary operator.  While potentially less readable for beginners, it demonstrates a more concise coding style.

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
  let output = "";
  output += (i % 3 === 0) ? "Fizz" : "";
  output += (i % 5 === 0) ? "Buzz" : "";
  console.log(output || i);
}
```

This version builds the output string incrementally. If `output` remains empty after checking for "Fizz" and "Buzz", it defaults to printing the number itself.


##  Beyond the Basics:  Improving Readability and Efficiency

While the above solutions work perfectly,  consider these points for larger-scale applications:

* **Function Decomposition:**  For better organization and reusability, encapsulate the FizzBuzz logic within a function.

```javascript
function fizzBuzz(n) {
  for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    // ... (same FizzBuzz logic as before) ...
  }
}

fizzBuzz(100);
```

* **Error Handling:** Add checks to handle invalid input (e.g., non-numeric input).
