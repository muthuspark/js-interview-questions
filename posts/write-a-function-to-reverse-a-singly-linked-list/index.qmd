Reversing a singly linked list is a classic computer science problem that tests your understanding of data structures and algorithms.  In JavaScript, where we don't have built-in linked list structures, we'll need to implement them first. This post will walk you through creating a function to reverse a singly linked list.

First, let's define a Node class and a LinkedList class to represent our linked list:

```javascript
class Node {
  constructor(data) {
    this.data = data;
    this.next = null;
  }
}

class LinkedList {
  constructor() {
    this.head = null;
  }

  append(data) {
    const newNode = new Node(data);
    if (!this.head) {
      this.head = newNode;
      return;
    }
    let current = this.head;
    while (current.next) {
      current = current.next;
    }
    current.next = newNode;
  }
}
```

Now, let's tackle the core problem: reversing the linked list.  There are many approaches, but an iterative approach is often preferred for its efficiency.  We'll use three pointers: `previous`, `current`, and `next`.

```javascript
function reverseLinkedList(list) {
  let previous = null;
  let current = list.head;
  let next = null;

  while (current) {
    next = current.next; // Store the next node
    current.next = previous; // Reverse the current node's pointer
    previous = current; // Move previous pointer forward
    current = next; // Move current pointer forward
  }

  list.head = previous; // Update the head of the list
}
```

Let's break down how this works:

1. **Initialization:** We start with `previous` as `null`, `current` as the head of the list, and `next` as `null`.

2. **Iteration:** The `while` loop continues as long as there are nodes left to process (`current` is not `null`).

3. **Pointer Manipulation:** Inside the loop, `next` stores the next node in the sequence.  Then, `current.next` is set to `previous`, effectively reversing the direction of the pointer.  `previous` is updated to `current`, and `current` moves to `next`.

4. **Head Update:** Finally, `list.head` is set to `previous`, which is now the tail of the original list, but the new head of the reversed list.

Here's an example of how to use this function:

```javascript
const myList = new LinkedList();
myList.append(1);
myList.append(2);
myList.append(3);
myList.append(4);
myList.append(5);


reverseLinkedList(myList);

let currentNode = myList.head;
let reversedList = "";
while (currentNode) {
  reversedList += currentNode.data + " ";
  currentNode = currentNode.next;
}

console.log(reversedList); // Output: 5 4 3 2 1 
```

This code creates a linked list, reverses it using `reverseLinkedList`, and then prints the reversed list to the console.  This demonstrates a clear and efficient way to reverse a singly linked list in JavaScript.  Remember that this solution operates in-place, modifying the original list directly, rather than creating a new reversed list.
