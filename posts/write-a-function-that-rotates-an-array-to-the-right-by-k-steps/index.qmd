# Rotating Arrays in JavaScript: A Rightward Shift

Rotating an array is a common programming task where you shift the elements of an array to the right (or left) by a specified number of steps.  This post will focus on rotating an array to the right by `k` steps in JavaScript, exploring different approaches and their efficiency.


## Understanding the Problem

Imagine you have an array: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.  Rotating it to the right by `k = 2` steps should result in `[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]`.  The last two elements have "wrapped around" to the beginning.

## Method 1: Using `splice()` and `unshift()`

This method is intuitive but less efficient for large arrays.  It uses JavaScript's built-in array manipulation functions.

```javascript
function rotateArrayRight(arr, k) {
  //Handle edge cases: empty array or k is 0 or larger than array length
  if(arr.length === 0 || k === 0 || k >= arr.length) return arr;

  k = k % arr.length; //Handle k larger than array length

  const rotatedElements = arr.splice(arr.length - k); //Remove last k elements
  arr.unshift(...rotatedElements); //Add removed elements to the beginning
  return arr;
}

const arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const k1 = 2;
console.log(rotateArrayRight(arr1, k1)); // Output: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]

const arr2 = [1,2,3,4,5];
const k2 = 7;
console.log(rotateArrayRight(arr2, k2)); //Output: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]

const arr3 = [];
const k3 = 2;
console.log(rotateArrayRight(arr3, k3)); //Output: []

const arr4 = [1,2,3,4,5];
const k4 = 0;
console.log(rotateArrayRight(arr4, k4)); //Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
```

`splice()` removes elements from the array, and `unshift()` adds elements to the beginning.  The modulo operator (`%`) handles cases where `k` is larger than the array length.


## Method 2: Using a Temporary Array

This method creates a temporary array to store the rotated elements, offering slightly better performance than the `splice()`/`unshift()` approach for larger datasets.

```javascript
function rotateArrayRight2(arr, k) {
    if(arr.length === 0 || k === 0 || k >= arr.length) return arr;
    k = k % arr.length;

  const tempArr = arr.slice(arr.length - k); //Create a temporary array of last k elements
  const rotatedArr = tempArr.concat(arr.slice(0, arr.length - k)); //Concat the temporary array with remaining elements
  return rotatedArr;
}

const arr5 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const k5 = 2;
console.log(rotateArrayRight2(arr5, k5)); // Output: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
```


## Method 3:  Cyclic Replacement (In-Place Rotation - Most Efficient)


This method performs the rotation in-place, directly modifying the original array without creating new arrays. This is the most efficient approach, especially for very large arrays, as it minimizes memory allocation.


```javascript
function rotateArrayRight3(arr, k){
    if(arr.length === 0 || k === 0 || k >= arr.length) return arr;
    k = k % arr.length;

    let i = arr.length -k -1;
    while(i>=0){
        let temp = arr[i];
        for(let j = i; j < arr.length-k; j++){
            arr[j] = arr[j+k];
        }
        arr[arr.length-k] = temp;
        i--;
    }
    return arr;

}

const arr6 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const k6 = 2;
console.log(rotateArrayRight3(arr6, k6)); // Output: [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
```

This method iterates through the array and performs a cyclic replacement of elements. While more complex to understand, it's faster for large arrays because it avoids the overhead of creating and copying arrays.


## Choosing the Right Method

The best method depends on the size of your array and your performance requirements. For small arrays, the simplicity of `splice()` and `unshift()` might be sufficient. For larger arrays, the in-place rotation (Method 3) provides the best performance.  The temporary array method (Method 2) offers a compromise between simplicity and performance.
